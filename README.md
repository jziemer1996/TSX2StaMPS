# TSX2StaMPS
This package serves for the preprocessing of high-resolution TerraSAR-X data provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for the ingestion in StaMPS, to process PSI time-series. It is an extension of the Snap2StaMPS package (https://github.com/mdelgadoblasco/snap2stamps) developed by JosÃ© Manuel Delgado Blasco and Michael Foumelis in collaboration with Prof. A. Hooper at the University of Leeds, to automate the pre-processing of Sentinel-1 SLC data and their preparation for ingestion to StaMPS. 

Since both packages serve for the same, but with different SAR data, the functionality of Snap2StaMPS was partly overtaken in TSX2StaMPS. The package consists of 6 processing steps, which are listed below:

1. Unpack SAR scenes
2. Prepare SAR scenes for preprocessing
3. Subsetting
4. Coregistration
5. Interferogram generation
6. Stamps Export

> **Note**:
> This package is part of the Snap2StaMPS_v2 software for the automated preprocessing of Sentinel-1 Topsar and TerraSAR-X Stripmap data, which was presented at the FRINGE conference in September 2023. For further information see the Snap2Stamps repository (https://github.com/mdelgadoblasco/snap2stamps) or the tutorial attached.
