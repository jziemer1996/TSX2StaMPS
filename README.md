# TSX2StaMPS
This package serves for the preprocessing of high-resolution TerraSAR-X data for the ingestion in StaMPS, to process PSI time-series. It is an extension of the SNAP2StaMPS packged developed by Jos√© Manuel Delgado Blasco, Michael Foumelis in collaboration with Prof. A. Hooper to automate the pre-processing of Sentinel-1 SLC data and their preparation for ingestion to StaMPS. Since both packages serve for the same, but with different SAR data, the functionality of SNAP2StaMPS was partly overtaken to TSX2StaMPS. The package consists of 6 processing steps, which are listed below:

1. Unpack SAR scenes
2. Prepare SAR scenes for preprocessing
3. Subsetting
4. Coregistration
5. Interferogram generation
6. Stamps Export
